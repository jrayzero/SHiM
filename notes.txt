Currently it seems like:
- don't put raw dyn_vars in arrays or vectors
- don't use auto with expressions on dyn_vars. or at least at the very end you should cast from builder::builder to dyn_var


TODO
- ask Ajay if there are any weird move semantics or things like that I should know about (talk about the
  issue where it doesn't actually evaluate all my staged code and it just shoves a while (1) loop in there...
  - possibly related to an issue where I had a segfault if I used builder::builder type as a loop bound,
  but no segfault if I casted it to a dyn_var
- add a realize_dispatch that checks if a variable is an int, dyn_var, or something else.
  - if int or dyn_var, just return it.
  - if something else, call item.realize on it
- are there stdlib funcs on dyn_vars? I need a floor division
